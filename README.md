# Jukebox ðŸŽ¶  

Welcome to **Jukebox**, a collection of scenario notebooks and pipelines designed to guide you through the AI/ML lifecycleâ€”from data exploration to production-ready deployments.  

## Repository Structure  

The content is organized into the following directories:  

- **1-data_exploration**: Explore and preprocess the dataset, and set up the feature store.  
- **2-dev_datascience**: Develop a simple model to test inference on the dataset.  
- **3-prod_datascience**: Build production-ready pipelines for continuous training, validation, and inference.  
- **4-metrics**: Set up TrustyAI to monitor data drift and model bias.  
- **5-data-versioning**: Use DVC to version the dataset for reproducible training.  
- **6-advanced_deployments**: Experiment with autoscaling and advanced deployment strategies.  
- **7-feature_store**: Configure Feast (Feature Store) and use it for real-time inference.  
- **8-securing_ai**: Explore security tools for AI/ML workloads.  
- **99-data_prep**: Prepares raw data before the lab. This is not used during the lab but can be utilized by the instructor to refresh the dataset beforehand.
